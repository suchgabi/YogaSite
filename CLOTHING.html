          <p>Lululemon athletica styled as lululemon athletica, is a Canadian athletic apparel retailer. Lululemon is a self-described yoga-inspired athletic apparel company for women and men. The company makes a variety of types of athletic wear, including performance shirts, shorts, and pants, as well as lifestyle apparel and yoga accessories. The company was originally based in Canada, but has expanded to sell its products internationally in both store fronts and online. While the brand is known for its stylish and high-quality items, it has been criticized for being "cultish, faddish and overpriced." The brand attempts to adopt a genuine, customer-education focus, but has been questioned as to whether it truly practices what it preaches.</p>
